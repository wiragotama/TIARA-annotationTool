# TIARA - A Lightweight Tool for Annotating Discourse Relations and Sentence Reordering
Annotation tool described in [our paper at LREC2020](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.854.pdf). Please kindly cite the following paper when you use this tool. **You can use this tool freely**, but it would be appreciated if you could send me a courtesy [email](https://wiragotama.github.io) so I could survey what kind of tasks the tool is used for.

## How to Use
- Fork, clone or download (+unpack) this repository
- Read the manual located at ```manual/``` folder
- Open ```index.html``` located at the root folder using a web browser.
- We have confirmed that the tool works on Google Chrome (ver 7.4++). You can use other web browsers at your own risk.
- Live demo: <https://wiragotama.github.io/TIARA-annotationTool/> (since this is a **client-side** tool, your data (essay) will not be uploaded, i.e., stays in your computer locally)

## Concept
There are many great annotation tools available out there. However, some (if not many) require complicated steps (and dependencies) to install. People with programming background may not find it difficult to install but people from other backgrounds may. This annotation tool considers the ease of use in mind (of course, with compromises), even for people without a programming background. That is why we provide this **client-side** annotation tool. The tool is customizable, by changing the conguration to suit your annotation scheme, as explained in the manual (configuration file: ```js/annotation-globalsetting.js```). 

## Formatting Text for Annotation
Format the text you want to annotate in ```.txt```, in which each discourse unit (sentence/clause) is separated by a newline. See at the following example (```sample_original/ESSAY_TRIAL_00.txt```).

```
I agree with the previous statement.
If somebody smokes in the restaurant, other people may not be able to enjoy the experience.
At restaurants, customers enjoy eating and talking.
However, if we ban smoking in restaurants, then those restaurants might lose some customers.
Some restaurants are indeed popular, especially among old men, because they allow people to smoke.
But, I firmly support banning smoking in restaurants because we need to prioritise health.
In conclusion, I encourage banning smoking in all restaurants.

``` 

## Important
- Refresh the web browser before working on another file (see the manual). <span style="color:gray"> While it should be generally safe without refreshing, we found super rare cases (when used by our annotator, and that we cannot reproduce) in which error happens when loading files into pre-existing workarea. </span>
- However, do not refresh the web browser midway (the annotation will be gone otherwise)

## Update!!
- ```2021/01/21```: There is a new ```Add New Sentence``` button at the bottom of the ```normal view```. This button is dedicated for educational uses. For example, a teacher asks a student to add more sentences to support their argument. Another example is when the teacher asks the student to merge two or more sentences as a single opinion. In this case, the student may "drop" those two or more sentences, and then create a new merged sentence. 
- ```2021/01/21```: You can now shrink and enlarge the hierarchical view
- ```2020/10/03```: TIARA can now open ```.tsv``` file that results from ```Format file to excel``` menu. Please note that the indentation and history do not present in the ```.tsv``` format.
