I don't agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. 
Of course there are both good aspects and bad aspects to having a part-time job. 
I'm going to write why I don't agree with the idea by showing both good aspects and bad aspects of having a part-time job. 
Let me explain. 
They say young people can acquire far more things than older people in the same time. 
If we have a part-time job, we can get some money, and getting money from one's work is surely a good thing. 
However, we can't actually have what we could have acquired if we had done something other than working. 
This is a bad aspect of having a part-time job. 
On the other hand, having a part-time job itself can teach something important to us. 
For example, through a part-time job, we can realize the value of money, or realize our parents' effort to raise us, know how we can give better service to customers, or encounter many people and enhance our knowledge. 
Those are the good aspects of having a part-time job, and we cannot do those things by just reading our textbooks or something like that. 
In my opinion, college students should regard their study as more important than anything else. 
If we want to experience the good aspects of having a part-time job, I think it is a good idea to have a short term part-time job. 
However, I think having a part-time job regularly can sometimes affect the quality of college students' learning. 
Therefore, I think it is better for them to study as much as possible rather than to spend their precious young years, unless they are in a financially difficult state.
