I agree with the previous statement.
I have a two reasons.
If somebody smokes in the restaurant, other people may not be able to enjoy the experience.
However, if we ban smoking in restaurants, then those restaurants might lose some customers.
But, I firmly support banning smoking in restaurants because we need to prioritise health.
Some restaurants are indeed popular, especially among old men, because they allow people to smoke.
In conclusion, I encourage banning smoking in all restaurants.
